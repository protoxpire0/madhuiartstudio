				<h2>Tasnuva Hasan</h2>
				<p>Tasnuva Hasan is an aspiring painter, designer and an art educator. A recent graduate of OCAD (B.A. Drawing and Painting), she has exhibited her works in trendy art galleries in the art communities across Toronto. Tasnuva has recently decided to establish her own studio, where she can create and exhibit her works, and focus on providing lessons to students of all ages who are interested in developing their own artistic talents. </p>
				<p>Madhuri Art studio had its grand opening on Aug.15 , 2014. Its location is in the heart of “ Little Bangladesh”, and is of particular significance since Tasnuva Hasan was born in Bangladesh. Madhuri Art Studio offers Tasnuva Hasan a way to connect to the members of her community.</p>
				<p> Tasnuva’s works are mainly abstract, though she also enjoys painting portraits and landscapes. Her abstract works explore textures and dimensions. The use of vibrant colour combinations is a feature in her paintings.</p>
				<p>Tasnuva Hasan’s ambitions will make Madhuri Art Studio a promising artistic establishment. </p>
